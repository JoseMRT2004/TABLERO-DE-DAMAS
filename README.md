The game of **Checkers** is a strategy board game for two players. 🎲 Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the board. The goal of the game is to capture or block all of the opponent's pieces, or to force them into a position where they cannot make a legal move. Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally across the board. 🏁

A piece becomes a 'king' 👑 when it reaches the last row on the opposite side of the board, gaining the ability to move both forward and backward. The game can be played either between two players 🤝 or against the CPU 🤖.
